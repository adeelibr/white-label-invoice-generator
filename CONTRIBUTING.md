## üöÄ Project Overview

The White Label Invoice Generator is a modern, responsive web application built with Next.js that allows users to create professional invoices with customizable branding. The application features:

- **Component Architecture**: Uses shadcn/ui components for consistent design
- **TypeScript**: Fully typed for better developer experience
- **Invoice Generation**: Create, customize, and export professional invoices
- **Theme Support**: Multiple themes and customizable branding options
- **Print/PDF Support**: Export invoices as PDF or print directly

## üõ† Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have the following installed:

- **npm** or **pnpm**: Latest stable version
- **Git**: For version control

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/white-label-invoice-generator.git
   cd white-label-invoice-generator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. **Open in Browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

### Environment Setup

The project may require environment variables for full functionality:

```bash
# Copy environment template (if exists)
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local with your configuration
```

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Standards

- Use **strict TypeScript** - all type errors must be resolved
- Prefer **interfaces** over types for object definitions
- Use **explicit return types** for functions
- Avoid `any` type - use proper typing or `unknown`

### React/Next.js Conventions

- Use **functional components** with hooks
- Follow **Next.js App Router** conventions
- Implement **proper error boundaries** where needed
- Use **React.forwardRef** for reusable components that need refs

### Component Structure

```tsx
// Good component structure
import React from 'react'
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils'

interface ComponentProps {
  title: string
  children?: React.ReactNode
  className?: string
}

export function Component({ title, children, className }: ComponentProps) {
  return (
    <div className={cn("base-classes", className)}>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Styling Guidelines

- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- Leverage **CSS custom properties** for theme variables
- Use the **cn()** utility function for conditional classes
- Follow **mobile-first** responsive design principles

### File Organization

```
/app                 # Next.js App Router pages
/components          # Reusable React components
  /ui               # Basic UI components (shadcn/ui)
  *.tsx             # Feature-specific components
/lib                 # Utility functions and configurations
/styles             # Global styles and Tailwind config
/public             # Static assets
```

## üîß Making Changes

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
