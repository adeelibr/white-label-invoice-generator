In the world of business documentation, invoices and receipts are often confused or used interchangeably. While both are important financial documents, they serve distinctly different purposes and have different legal and accounting implications. Understanding these differences is crucial for proper business management, accurate accounting, and tax compliance.

The key is using the right document at the right time: invoices when requesting payment, receipts when confirming payment received. This clarity helps maintain professional relationships, ensures proper accounting practices, and provides the documentation needed for tax and legal purposes.
